Firefox (Version 62.0.3 (64-bit)) -> Fully Functional 

Opera (Version	48.0.2685.39) -> Fully Functional 

## Responsiveness

Mobile -> All size screens tested to be fully functional on Chrome Dev Tools


## Production Build

The production build is in the /dist folder from where the build can be used directly.
NOTE: Directly opening index.html in browser might give a "CORS" or Cross origin error because of the included flight-data.json file which is serving the dummy data for us.
**Most Flight data are from Mumbai to Kolkata on 1st of November 2017**
**Use range bar to modify range if initial request shows no flights**
